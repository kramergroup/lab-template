# (001) Surface energy

The surface energy is defined by

$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{2A}\left(E_{\rm slab} - E_{\rm bulk}\right)
$$

It is the difference between the energy of a slab and an *equivalent* number of bulk atoms divided by the total surface area of the slab.

Calculate the surface energy of Cu(001) surfaces. A possible approach:

1. Start with the initial bulk structure and create a sufficiently big supercell to encompass the slab (say 1x1x10)
2. Fully relax the bulk supercell structure
3. Make calculation in the z direction non-periodic and add some vacuum on both sides of the slab
4. Relax the atomic coordinates

You can do both in one calculation or use the `restart` feature in LAMMPS. You can than directly compare the total energies to obtain the cleavage and surface energies.

The `replicate` command can be very useful to create slabs and other geometries. It replicates the existing unit cell in each direction

```lammps
replicate 1 1 10
```

will create a unit cell that is 10-times in the z-direction.

You should also account for the possiblity of atoms moving outside the simulation box. If this happens across a periodic boundary, the atom is just reintroduced on the other side. **But atoms are lost if they cross fixed, non-periodic boundaries**. You can add additional space to a simulation with the `change_box` command.

For example, The following command will change the z-dimension of the simulation box to stretch from -1 to 15 (times the lattice spacing) and adjust the boundary condition type to `fixed` for the z-direction:

```lammps
change_box all z final -1 15 boundary p p f 
```

You can visualise the result with [Ovito](https://www.ovito.org/) if you install it locally on your computer. Unfortortunately, graphical software cannot be used easily on the cluster terminal.


> Ovito is also very useful to investige variables associated with atoms (such as the centro-symmetry to investigate coordination). You can visualise atom-based variables by clicking on `Add Modification` on the right-hand side and choosing `Color coding`.

:::action Lab report
You should perform some convergence studies:

1. What slab thickness is needed to converge the surface energy?
2. Does the surface energy change when making the slabs bigger orthogonal to the surface?

Your report should contain the convergence study as well as an analysis of the surface relaxation and a discussion.

- How much and in which direction do the surface atoms relax?
- Can you relate the cohesive (or bulk bond energy) to the surface energy? Would you expect a larger or smaller energy based on the coordination loss at the surface?
- You could also compare your result with literature data (experimental and theoretical).
