# Backends

Two options are available:

- Wetty - a WebSocket-based terminal implementation
- Guacamole - a WebSocket-based remote desktop application

:::warn
Both backends require setting up backing services and will not work "out-of-the-box".
:::

## Wetty

Wetty is good for terminal-based labs and tutorials. It is fast and feature-rich. The user experience is very close
to what working on a "real" terminal feels like. More info regarding setup can be found on the 
[Wetty Developer Page](https://github.com/butlerx/wetty). In particular, Wetty can act as a bridge to systems that 
are accessed through `ssh`. At the moment, Wetty does not support file transfer out of the box.

The Wetty backend service can be configured in `app.config.js`:

| parameter     | description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `backendType` | set to `"wetty"`                                |
| `backendURL`  | set to URL of backing service (i.e., wetty app) |

:::info
You do **not** configure the actual backend to work on (which you normally access through `ssh`) in the web app.
This is done when setting up the Wetty service.
:::

The web app currently **does not** support authentication in any form. This is handled by Wetty, which presents 
a login prompt if configured to use a remote ssh service.
