This site template enables fast and easy creation of *go-along* tutorials. 

## Sample Environment

Chances are, if you see this page, you have already successfully started the sample environment with

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You can then point your browser at 

```http
http://localhost:3030
```

to test the production build. You can also start the development server, which updates content as you code, with

```bash
yarn dev
```

:::info[Backend during development]
As long as you have the docker-compose environment up, your development environment should even be able to access the backend.
