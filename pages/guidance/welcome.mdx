# Welcome

This lab will give you opportunity to experiment with empirical potentials to simulate surfaces. We will use [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/) (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator), which is freely available for a number of operating systems. 

:::info HPC02 usage
Although we utilise HPC02, we will work with relatively small systems that should readily run on almost any hardware. In fact, you should still be able to run most calculations in the lab on your own laptop.
:::

LAMMPS is a very popular empirical potential code with a large user base. That means you can find a wealth of help and tutorials online. Some pointers can be found at the end of this page.

## Structure of the lab

We will

1. look at a few key aspects of interacting with LAMMPS
2. walk through an input file line-by-line to understand what it does
3. run a few "warming" up calculations
4. introduce the scientific problem to address during the lab (you are expected to write up this part)
