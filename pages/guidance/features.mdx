# Features

You write your guidance using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with some additional features configured as well:

- Support for LaTeX math mode
- Pre-formated remark container

## LaTeX Support

You can render LaTeX math directly within your page. For instance,

```bash
$$ 
f(x) = \sin(x) 
$$
```

will render to 

$$ 
f(x) = \sin(x)
$$

and inline math such as $\sqrt{x + 3}$ is set with

```bash
$\sqrt{x + 3}$
```

## Remark container

You can use a small number of remark container to emphasise something. Pre-defined container environments are

| Tag      | Purpose                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `info`   | Some further info                             |
| `tip`    | A useful tip                                  |
| `action` | An action that you expect the user to perform |
| `warn`   | A warning about something                     |
| `image`  | To emphasise images and provide label places  |

Container environments are created with the custom `:::` symbol (that is not part of Markdown).

```markdown
:::tip Custom container
You can define your own container environments using 
the global css file (`/styles/global.css`). Styling 
for a custom container environment `myenv` uses the 
`.remark-container.myenv` CSS selector.
