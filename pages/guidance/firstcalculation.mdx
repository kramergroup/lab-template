# First Calculation

:::info Ready, steady, go
We are ready for a first calculation!

Let's run the static input file

```bash
lmp < fix_fcc_Cu.in
```

That should not take longer than a second. Take some time to go through the output. LAMMPS first informs us that we haven't set `OMP_NUM_THREADS`. LAMMPS is fully parallelised using a hybrid of OpenMP and MPI. Because we run on a single computer, it uses just one MPI process (it falls back to an MPI stub that does nothing actually, because we are not running in an MPI environment), and it uses one thread because we have not set `OMP_NUM_THREADS`. You can set this environment varialbe to use more threads with

```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
```

This might be useful for more complex calculations to save some computational time.

It then tells us about the computational domain and how it has been distributed across MPI processes before creating four atoms in the box. It creates four atoms because we work in the crystallographic unitcell with cubic symmetry. Finnally, it reads the potential, builds the initial neighbour list before doing a single point calculation.

It dumps information from this one time-step in a line using the format that we defined in the input file.

You should take note of the total potential energy, which is

$$
E_{\rm tot} = -14.16\,{\rm eV}
$$
