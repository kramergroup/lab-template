# Scaling analysis

Analyse the scaling behaviour of EAM. Investigate the runtime of a static run (no relaxations etc.) as a function of system size. You can do this by

1. Starting from a copy of the `fix_fcc_Cu.in` file
2. And changing the `simbox` region.

:::action Lab report
Produce a figure showing runtime as function of number of atoms and discuss the observed trend.
