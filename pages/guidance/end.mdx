# Where to go from here?

There are many other aspects that can be investigated:

- Relative stability of other facets
- Interfaces between different materials
- Position and mobility of adatoms
- ...

If you like to explore more, investigating the stability of a Cu adatom is an interesting topic to investigate? Which site on the surface is most favorable and why? 

> *Hint*: You can add atoms conviniently with `create_atoms single n m k`, where the indices are in lattice units.
